## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get the chatbot up and running in your React project.

### 1. Add Files to Your Project

First, copy the following files into your project's `components` directory (or your preferred location):

-   `FloatingChatbot.tsx`
-   `FloatingChatbot.css`

### 2. Install Dependencies

This component requires a few peer dependencies. You can install them using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-markdown

or

yarn add react-markdown

3. Set Up Environment Variables
To securely use your Google Gemini API key, it's best to store it in an environment variable. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your key:

VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Note: If you are not using Vite, access your environment variables according to your project's setup (e.g., process.env.REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY for Create React App).

4. Import and Use the Component
Finally, import the component into any page or layout file and render it.

import FloatingChatbot from './components/FloatingChatbot';

function App() {
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;

  return (
    <div>
